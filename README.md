# BetterStart

**BetterStart** is a lightweight **startup management system** designed specifically for small startups.  
It is offered as a **SaaS product** and provides a set of tools to streamline core startup operations.


## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Project Management** ‚Äì Manage projects, tasks, and workflows with ease.  
2. **HR Management with AI-Driven CV Evaluation** ‚Äì Automate CV screening and improve hiring efficiency.  
3. **Legal GPT** ‚Äì AI-powered generation of legal documents contextualized for Bangladeshi laws.

## üèó Architecture

BetterStart is built on a **microservices architecture** for scalability and maintainability.

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Provision Infrastructure**  
   - Create a **private AWS S3 bucket** with proper **ACL**, **CORS policy**, and **encryption** using the AWS Management Console.  
   **OR**  
   - Use **Terraform** for automated provisioning (recommended):  
     ```bash
     cd terraform/envs/dev
     terraform init
     terraform plan
     terraform apply --auto-approve
     ```

   This will automatically configure:  
   ‚úÖ S3 bucket with **CORS**, **Lifecycle Policies**, and **SSE-KMS encryption**.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   - Navigate to the project root.  
   - For each service (`backend`, `frontend`, `worker`), copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values.  
   - Ensure **S3 bucket name** is correctly set in the `backend` `.env` file.

3. **Run Services with Docker**  
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

   This starts:  
   ‚úÖ **Backend API**  
   ‚úÖ **Frontend Web App**  
   ‚úÖ **RabbitMQ Message Broker**  
   ‚úÖ **RabbitMQ Worker**

4. **Access URLs**  
   - **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`  
   - **Backend API Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`  
   - **RabbitMQ Management UI:** `http://localhost:15672`

## üí™ Strengths

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**  
  - Automates provisioning of S3 bucket policies, **CORS rules**, **Lifecycle management**, and **SSE-KMS encryption with key rotation**.  
  - Improves **consistency**, **repeatability**, and **security** of infrastructure.

- **Microservices Architecture**  
  - Highly **scalable**, **modular**, and **maintainable** design.  
  - Services (Backend, Frontend, Workers, Messaging) are **decoupled**, enabling independent deployment and scaling.  

- **Secure by Design**  
  - Enforces **S3 bucket encryption** using **AWS KMS**.  
  - Private bucket with **restricted ACL** for better data protection.

- **Cloud-Native & Containerized**  
  - Uses **Docker** for reproducible environments across development and production.
  - Supports **horizontal scaling** and easy orchestration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Full Deployment (Coming Soon)

We are working on a **complete deployment setup** using **Terraform** and **Ansible** to automate the entire infrastructure and application deployment process.  

This will include:  
- Provisioning all required cloud resources.  
- Configuring services and dependencies automatically.  
- End-to-end deployment of frontend, backend, and workers.
